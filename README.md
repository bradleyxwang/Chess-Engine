# Python Chess Engine

This is a chess engine that I created using Python's tkinter graphical user interface. The chess engine implements a minimax + alpha/beta pruning algorithm. The user plays white and the chess engine plays black.

There is also a 2 player version in the file named "ChessPython2Player.py".
